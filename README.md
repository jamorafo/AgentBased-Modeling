# Agent-Based Modeling

Welcome to the AgentBased-Modeling repository! This space is dedicated to the exploration and dissemination of agent-based models (ABMs) in various domains, including ecology, economics, social science, and more.

## Structure

This repository is organized into several directories to help you navigate through different stages of agent-based modeling:

- `/input`: This directory contains all the input data files used for running the simulations. It may include parameter configurations, initial state descriptions, and any external data necessary for initializing the models.

- `/output`: Here, you'll find the output data from the simulations. This can range from raw numerical results to processed data ready for analysis or visualization.

- `/src`: The source code directory includes all the scripts used to run the simulations and analyze the data. You might find NetLogo models, R scripts, Python code, or other software-specific scripts here.

## Usage

To run the simulations, navigate to the `/src` directory and follow the instructions in the script headers. Input data can be modified in the `/input` directory to experiment with different scenarios.

## Contributing

We encourage contributions to this repository! If you have an interesting ABM to share, feel free to fork this repository, add your model, and submit a pull request.

## Contact

If you have any questions or would like to discuss the models and their applications, please open an issue in this repository.

Thank you for visiting our ABM repository. We hope these models serve as a valuable resource for your research or educational purposes!
